Proceeding with Approach A (Promote Binary to UTF-8 during Reads)

This approach involves handling the issue during the read process in Spark by converting Impala’s BINARY type (non-UTF-8 encoded) into UTF-8 strings. The primary goal is to fix the encoding issues without modifying the source files or metadata. Here’s how you can implement this:

Steps to Implement Approach A

1. Identify Binary Columns

	•	Check which columns in the Impala table are causing issues. Typically, these are stored as BINARY but should be treated as UTF-8 STRING.
	•	Use DESCRIBE in Impala to find the schema of the table:

DESCRIBE iceberg_migration533;



2. Read the Iceberg Table in Spark

Use Spark to read the Iceberg table into a DataFrame:

df = spark.read.format("iceberg").load("iceberg_migration533")

3. Promote Binary to UTF-8

For columns with the BINARY type, explicitly cast them into STRING during the read. This can be done with PySpark’s pyspark.sql.functions. Below is an example:

from pyspark.sql.functions import col, decode

# Identify binary columns
binary_columns = ["customer_name", "example_column"]

# Convert binary columns to UTF-8
for column in binary_columns:
    df = df.withColumn(column, decode(col(column), "utf-8"))

# Show the resulting DataFrame
df.show(100)

Explanation:
	•	decode(col(column), "utf-8"): Converts binary data in the column to a UTF-8 encoded string.
	•	withColumn: Replaces the column with its UTF-8-decoded version.

4. Validate Data

After decoding, inspect the data to ensure all columns are correctly converted:

df.select(*binary_columns).show(truncate=False)

5. (Optional) Save the Fixed Data

If you need to persist the changes for further use:
	•	Overwrite the existing Iceberg table:

df.write.format("iceberg").mode("overwrite").save("iceberg_migration533_fixed")


	•	Or save to a new table:

df.write.format("iceberg").saveAsTable("iceberg_migration533_fixed")

Benefits of Approach A

	•	Non-destructive: Does not modify the source files or metadata.
	•	Specific Fix: Targets only the affected columns during the read.
	•	Efficient: No need to rewrite the entire table, just fix the schema interpretation.

Notes

	1.	Performance Impact:
	•	The decode() function may add some overhead during the read operation, depending on the table size and number of affected columns.
	2.	Edge Cases:
	•	If the binary column contains invalid or corrupt UTF-8 sequences, the decode() function might fail. In such cases, you can use a fallback to handle errors:

from pyspark.sql.functions import when

df = df.withColumn(
    "customer_name",
    when(col("customer_name").isNotNull(), decode(col("customer_name"), "utf-8")).otherwise("")
)


	3.	Column Validation:
Ensure that columns interpreted as BINARY in Impala are indeed UTF-8 encoded data. If not, you may need a custom logic to handle mixed or invalid encodings.
