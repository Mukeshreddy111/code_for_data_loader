I’m working on a POC for our Modern Data Platform using Cloudera Ozone + Iceberg.

The goal is not to productionize anything yet, but to validate and recommend a standard.

What I need help with:
	1.	Create a minimal Iceberg POC on Ozone using OFS (FSO)
	•	Use Spark with a Hadoop Iceberg catalog
	•	Warehouse path via ofs://
	•	Create one database and one small Iceberg table
	•	Insert a few rows and read them back
	2.	Validate whether the same underlying Ozone data can be accessed via the S3 Gateway
	•	Do we have an S3 Gateway enabled for the same Ozone volumes used by OFS?
	•	If yes, what is the correct s3a:// bucket/path mapping for an OFS path like:
ofs://<service-id>/user/<user>/iceberg_poc/warehouse
	3.	Confirm the supported pattern
	•	Is OFS the recommended canonical write path for Iceberg tables?
	•	Is S3 Gateway intended for read/integration access to the same data?
	•	Are there any known limitations when accessing Iceberg metadata/data via S3 vs OFS?

Please keep the answer minimal and platform-accurate:
	•	No multi-catalog setups unless required
	•	No performance benchmarking yet
	•	Focus on correctness, supported access patterns, and guardrails
