The error indicates that your Hadoop setup is unable to locate certain configuration files related to metrics:
	•	hadoop-metrics2-xceiverclientmetrics.properties
	•	hadoop-metrics2.properties

These configuration files are typically used to configure Hadoop’s metrics system (for monitoring and diagnostics). Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. Verify the Configuration Directory
	•	Check if the directory containing the Hadoop configuration files (e.g., $HADOOP_CONF_DIR) is correctly set in your environment.
	•	Run:

echo $HADOOP_CONF_DIR

This should point to the directory where all configuration files (core-site.xml, hdfs-site.xml, etc.) are stored. If not, export it:

export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/path/to/hadoop/conf

Add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to persist it.

2. Check the Metrics Files
	•	Ensure the required metrics configuration files (hadoop-metrics2-xceiverclientmetrics.properties and hadoop-metrics2.properties) exist in the configuration directory:

ls $HADOOP_CONF_DIR


	•	If these files are missing, you can create or copy them.

Example: hadoop-metrics2.properties

Here is a basic example of hadoop-metrics2.properties:

*.period=10
*.sink.file.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.sink.FileSink
*.sink.file.filename=/tmp/hadoop-metrics.out

Example: hadoop-metrics2-xceiverclientmetrics.properties

This file might not always be present but can often inherit configurations from hadoop-metrics2.properties.

3. Permissions
	•	Ensure the Hadoop configuration directory and files have appropriate permissions for the user running Hadoop:

chmod -R 755 $HADOOP_CONF_DIR

4. Review Logs
	•	Check Hadoop logs for more specific information about the missing configuration or paths it’s trying to resolve. Look in:
	•	$HADOOP_HOME/logs
	•	Application logs (e.g., yarn, namenode, etc.).

5. Metrics System Not Needed?

If you are not using the metrics system, you can disable the warnings by either:
	•	Creating empty placeholder files for hadoop-metrics2-xceiverclientmetrics.properties and hadoop-metrics2.properties.
	•	Configuring your log4j.properties or log4j2.properties to suppress these warnings.

6. Documentation or Templates
	•	Check Hadoop’s documentation or the conf directory in your Hadoop installation for sample files:

find $HADOOP_HOME -name "*.properties"
