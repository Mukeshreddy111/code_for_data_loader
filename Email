Subject: Request for Employment Contract Extension

Hi [Manager’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to let you know that my H-1B petition was selected in this year’s lottery. As part of the next steps in the filing process, my employer needs my employment contract to be extended through at least December 31st, 2025.

Would it be possible to extend my current contract accordingly? This extension is essential for moving forward with the H-1B process.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from my end. I truly appreciate your support.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
