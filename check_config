We are running Cloudera Ozone version 1.4.0.7.1.9.1059-4.

Using ONLY the ozone-default.xml that ships with this exact version,
extract ALL configuration properties that affect Ozone S3 Gateway behavior.

Please do the following:

1) Extract ALL S3 Gateway–specific properties:
   - Every property starting with ozone.s3g.*

2) Extract ALL additional S3 protocol properties that are used by the S3 Gateway:
   - Properties starting with ozone.s3.* that affect multipart uploads, multipart copy,
     listing limits, upload expiry, or other S3 API behavior.

For EACH property, return:
- Property name
- Default value
- Description (exactly as defined in ozone-default.xml)

Present the results in TWO CLEARLY SEPARATED TABLES:

Section 1: S3 Gateway–specific properties (ozone.s3g.*)
Section 2: Additional S3 protocol properties affecting S3 Gateway behavior (ozone.s3.*)

This should be the ACTUAL extracted list from ozone-default.xml for this version,
NOT documentation summaries, assumptions, or examples.
Do not omit DNS-related properties if they exist in this version.
Do not include analysis or recommendations.
