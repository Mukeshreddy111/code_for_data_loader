Please run the extraction yourself and return the actual results.

Using the ozone-default.xml that ships with Cloudera Ozone
version 1.4.0.7.1.9.1059-4:

- Extract ALL properties related to the S3 Gateway
- Include all ozone.s3g.* properties
- Include any additional S3-related properties that affect S3 Gateway behavior

Return the final output as a table with:

This should be the actual extracted list, not instructions or examples.
