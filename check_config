We are running Cloudera Ozone version 1.4.0.7.1.9.1059-4.

Please identify the EXACT filesystem path(s) where ozone-default.xml
is located for this installed version in our environment.

If there are multiple possible locations (parcel-based, client-only, etc.),
list all valid paths and indicate which one is used by the running Ozone services.

Do not give examples or generic locations — return the actual paths
present on the system.
