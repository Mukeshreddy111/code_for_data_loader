What exact Apache Ozone version (and distribution/parcel build) is currently installed in our environment?
Please also identify the path to the ozone-default.xml file that corresponds to this running version.


++++
From the ozone-default.xml that matches our installed Ozone version, extract ALL configuration properties related to the S3 Gateway.

Specifically:
- All properties starting with ozone.s3g.*
- Any additional S3-related properties that affect S3 Gateway behavior (for example ozone.s3.* or relevant HTTP/TLS settings)

For each property, return:
- Property name
- Default value
- Description (from ozone-default.xml)

++++++++
Please return the results as a clean table (property | default | description) suitable for sharing in Slack or Confluence.
Do NOT evaluate or recommend settings; this is inventory only.
