I went through the Book of Work and what we talked about. I’m interested in focusing on a few related areas around Ozone storage — things like understanding replication behavior, OFS vs S3 performance tradeoffs, WebHDFS compatibility, and helping define some sane base configs for volumes, buckets, and permissions.

I’m also interested in helping with migration to CDE and Airflow, especially moving existing code and workflows to run cleanly in CDE-based Spark environments and Airflow, and figuring out where the rough edges are.

On top of that, I’d like to help with RTO improvements, particularly around Iceberg snapshot replication, and updating onboarding docs so teams have clearer guardrails when they start using Ozone.

I can start by getting familiar with how things work today, testing in lower envs, and documenting what works and what doesn’t so migrations and onboarding are smoother.
