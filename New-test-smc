Look at swap_master_confirm_terms.py and grid_panel.py.

We confirmed that before sync, the Jurisdiction dropdownâ€™s EditorSettings['Items'] has the correct list, but after sync (in Python 3.11 / QZ new build) the dropdown shows empty even though the print statements show 4 values.

Find where the UI or grid resets or overwrites the EditorSettings after sync_regulation_ui_to_model(), and suggest the best place to re-apply or preserve the 'Items' and 'value' for the 'Jurisdiction' column so the dropdown displays correctly.

Show the exact function name and line number where that reset happens, and give me the corrected code block that ensures the Jurisdiction dropdown keeps the assigned hardcoded values.
