In swap_master_confirm_terms.py, check how EditorSettings for the Jurisdiction column is used after calling sync_regulation_ui_to_model().

I want to confirm whether the grid’s dropdown values are being overwritten or rebuilt later, for example inside ShowTable() or during refreshGridData().

Can you search all references of EditorSettings or ColumnProperties in this file and related grid files (like grid_panel.py or baml_oet_rights_grid_tool.py), and tell me:

1️⃣ Where the EditorSettings['Items'] values are set or rebuilt.
2️⃣ Whether any later function (after sync_regulation_ui_to_model) resets them.
3️⃣ If so, where is the right place to re-apply my hardcoded values permanently (post-sync or post-refresh).

Also note: in 3.11 the dropdown is empty even though the logs show Items populated. 3.9 works fine.
