Subject: Request for Assistance: Unable to Use Historical Metadata When Migrating Iceberg Tables from HDFS to Ozone

Description:

Dear Cloudera Support Team,

We are facing an issue during the migration of Iceberg tables from HDFS to Ozone where the historical metadata becomes inaccessible or unusable post-migration. This is impacting our ability to query historical table versions and maintain data lineage, which are critical for our operations. Below are the comprehensive details of the issue:

1. Issue Summary:
	•	Description:
	•	We are migrating Iceberg tables from HDFS to Ozone using [specific tool or process, e.g., Iceberg APIs or a custom migration script].
	•	While the data files are successfully moved, the historical metadata (e.g., snapshot information) is either corrupted, lost, or incompatible in the Ozone environment.
	•	Queries that rely on historical versions of the tables fail, even though the latest table state appears intact.
	•	Observed Behavior:
	•	Accessing historical metadata results in errors such as: [Provide specific errors, e.g., “Metadata file not found” or “Snapshot version not recognized”].
	•	Queries involving rollback or time-travel functionality are not returning the expected results.
	•	Expected Behavior:
	•	Historical metadata should remain consistent and usable after the migration, enabling versioned queries and rollback functionality.
	•	Affected Services/Components:
	•	Iceberg table metadata
	•	Ozone storage integration with Iceberg metadata
	•	Possibly Hive/Presto/Spark integrations for querying Iceberg tables
	•	Start Time:
	•	[Provide the date/time when the issue was first observed, e.g., after completing the migration or during initial testing.]
	•	Current Impact:
	•	Severity: High
	•	Business Impact:
	•	Historical queries (e.g., rollback or snapshot-based queries) are critical for compliance and audit requirements.
	•	Downstream processes relying on versioned data are disrupted.
	•	Data lineage tracking and recovery processes are compromised.

2. Environment Details:
	•	Cloudera Distribution Version: [e.g., CDP 7.x.x or CDH version.]
	•	Iceberg Version: [Provide the specific version, if known.]
	•	Ozone Version and Configuration:
	•	Version: [e.g., 1.x.x]
	•	Bucket Type: [e.g., FS Optimized or Key Optimized]
	•	Replication Policy: [e.g., 3x replication or erasure coding]
	•	Cluster Configuration:
	•	HDFS: [Number of nodes, replication factor, etc.]
	•	Ozone: [Number of nodes, bucket configurations, etc.]
	•	Compute Layer: [Spark, Hive, Presto, etc., along with versions and configurations.]
	•	Operating System: [e.g., CentOS 7.9, Ubuntu 20.04]
	•	Storage Layout Details:
	•	Original HDFS Layout: [e.g., Directory structure for tables and metadata.]
	•	Ozone Layout: [How data and metadata are being stored in Ozone buckets.]

3. Steps to Reproduce:
	1.	Create Iceberg tables in HDFS with multiple snapshots (historical metadata).
	2.	Migrate tables from HDFS to Ozone using [specific method/tool, e.g., Iceberg table rewrite, Ozone distcp, or custom migration script].
	3.	Load the migrated tables in the Ozone environment using [query engine/tool].
	4.	Attempt to query historical snapshots or perform rollback operations.
	5.	Observe errors or missing metadata issues.

4. Logs and Diagnostics:
	•	Relevant Logs:
	•	Ozone service logs during migration and table access ([Attach specific logs or highlight error snippets]).
	•	Iceberg logs, if available ([Provide relevant debug/trace outputs]).
	•	Query engine logs (e.g., Hive/Presto/Spark logs showing errors when accessing historical metadata).
	•	Error Messages:
	•	[Include exact error messages or stack traces, e.g., “Error: Metadata snapshot file not found” or “Invalid snapshot ID.”]
	•	Diagnostic Commands:
	•	Ran Iceberg metadata inspection commands, e.g., SHOW SNAPSHOTS; - [State results, if any.]
	•	Validated Ozone bucket contents to confirm metadata files were migrated successfully.

5. Troubleshooting Efforts:
	•	Pre-Migration Validation:
	•	Verified historical metadata consistency in HDFS using Iceberg commands and queries.
	•	Ensured Iceberg snapshot structure was intact before migration.
	•	Migration Steps:
	•	Used [specific tool/method] to copy data and metadata from HDFS to Ozone.
	•	Ensured data files and metadata files were copied without errors.
	•	Post-Migration Checks:
	•	Confirmed that data files were present in Ozone.
	•	Verified Iceberg table registration in Ozone using [query engine/tool].
	•	Attempted to rebuild metadata, but historical metadata remained inaccessible.

6. Potential Root Causes (Suspicions):
	•	Metadata file structure differences between HDFS and Ozone causing incompatibility.
	•	Changes in Ozone bucket layout or permissions impacting metadata access.
	•	Iceberg’s reliance on absolute paths for metadata references, which may not align with Ozone’s storage model.
	•	Potential bugs or limitations in Iceberg-Ozone integration.

7. Urgency and Business Impact:
	•	Urgency Level: High
	•	Business Impact:
	•	Compliance Risk: Historical data queries are required for audits and compliance reports.
	•	Workflow Disruption: ETL processes and downstream analytics relying on time-travel capabilities are failing.
	•	Data Recovery Challenges: The inability to access historical metadata increases risks of data recovery failures.

8. Additional Information:
	•	Related Environment Changes:
	•	Recent upgrades to [versions of Cloudera, Ozone, or Iceberg, if applicable].
	•	Modifications to storage policies during migration.
	•	References:
	•	Iceberg Documentation: [Include links to relevant Iceberg/Ozone integration documentation.]
	•	Previous Support Tickets: [Mention any related issues/tickets, if applicable.]

We request your guidance on resolving this issue. Specifically, we would like:
	1.	Confirmation of best practices for migrating Iceberg tables from HDFS to Ozone.
	2.	Assistance in diagnosing and resolving the metadata compatibility issue.
	3.	Any recommendations or workarounds to restore historical metadata functionality.

Please let us know if additional details or access to the environment are required.
